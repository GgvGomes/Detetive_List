# About

This repository is a combination of some simple forms that contain some checkboxes.

# Why?

Well I have the Detective board game, it came with some cards so you could mark the cards you knew weren't there. One day I ran out of chips, so I decided to create this simple app to use on my cell phone.

# Using:

This application was built using: React, TypeScript and forms.
